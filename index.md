## Bridge your iCloud Keychain to Windows.

This extension is intended for users of iCloud Keychain that have a Windows PC.  
It fills out passwords automatically and doesn't keep any data.  
It uses one-time pad encryption and QR codes to link your phone to Chrome.  
Once the password is filled, the encryption key is discarded and cannot be reused.
